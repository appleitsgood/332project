## 2. Progress in the week
### Team Progress

1. Completed Implementation of local sort & Master-Worker connection.
2. Progressing in Sampling & Partitioning

---
## 3. Internal Feedback

1. Presentation Feedback:
   - Presentation was pointless in some manner. 
   - Needs to show more detail on operation logic rather than basic structure(which was too obvious).
   - Strongly consider fixing milestones. There is not enough time to complete fault tolerance with the current speed.
   
2. Now it's a solo project. Maximize efficiency of time-usage & AI tools. There is a lot more tasks to do(report, final ppts, etc.)
3. Aim for submitting at least a functioning software, report with all required contents, and presentation.
