## 2. Progress in the week
### Team Progress

1. Completed Merge Implementation & Basic local Testing

---
## 3. Internal Feedback

1. Merge implementation took more than expected due to unexpected errors in performance test.
2. Not quite sure if the build is stable. Possible to fail when met with edge-cases.
3. Failed to implement fault tolerance.
4. Presentation might be focused on why this project fell short. Not a lot of progress is there to present in front of class. Definitely concerned of how to explain this result.
